* Understand the code. Ask questions on Piazza!

* Testing correctness:

  - Develop test cases following the guidelines below:
       * construct lists of varying lengths
       * check that the result has no duplicates
       * the check should take constant time O(1) and not take time
       proportional to the length of the list O(n)
  - Hint 1: use lists with lots of duplicates; the resulting list will be short
  - Hint 2: take a small number of samples from the resulting list and confirm 
    they are distinct

* Testing efficiency:

  - Time the execution time of the five methods for lists of varying lengths and
  confirm that the numbers fit the expected complexity bounds which should
  be O(n), O(n log n), and O(n^2).
